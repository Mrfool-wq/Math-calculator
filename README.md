# Simple Math — Beginner to Intermediate

This small site teaches and calculates basic-to-intermediate math with short step-by-step explanations.

Files:
- index.html — main page and UI
- styles.css — simple styling
- script.js — calculators and explanation steps

How to host on GitHub Pages:
1. Create a new repository on GitHub (example name: `Math-Calculator`).
2. Add these files to the repository root.
3. Commit and push to the `main` branch.
4. Go to the repository Settings → Pages, choose Branch = `main` and folder = `/ (root)`, then Save.
5. After a minute, your site will be available at:
   `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`
   e.g. `https://Mrfool-wq.github.io/Math-Calculator/`

Quick git commands:
```bash
# locally
mkdir Math-Calculator
cd Math-Calculator
# create files (index.html, styles.css, script.js, README.md) with the content above
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial simple math site"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Mrfool-wq/Math-Calculator.git
git push -u origin main
```

Want me to create and push the repo?
- I can if you re-authorize the integration. After you accept the authorization prompt, reply here and I'll create the public repository Math-Calculator and push the files.
